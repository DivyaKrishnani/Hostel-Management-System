			mineral rich state having enormous potential for development with seemingly inexhaustible natural
			resources of coal, iron ore, lime stones, dolomite, tin, gem-stones and other minerals. Many industries,
			such as those of cement, steel, steel alooy, mines etc., are located in the vicinity of the institute
			giving it a unique advantage for industry-institute interaction in various disciplines of engineering.

				with mess. All the hostel rooms are adequately furnished. Each hostel has a capacity to house about
				100 inmate students.

				Administrative head of each hostel, the warden, is a senior faculty member. Additionally, one
				caretaker/matron for each hostel exists to manage the day-to-day affairs of the hostel. Each hostel
				has different students working committees, mess committee, magazine committee, games committee,
				cleanliness committee etc. Each committee is responsible for specific aspects of hostel affairs.
				Separate hostel administrative section exists in the institute to manage the hostel matters.
